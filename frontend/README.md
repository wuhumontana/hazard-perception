# Hazard Perception Frontend

## Test Environment

The command to run the frontend is `yarn dev`. This is an
alias for `yarn vite`. Make sure you have pulled and ran `yarn`
to update all the required packages to the node_modules folder.
The default port for the frontend is 5173.

Before pushing, ensure that you have ran `yarn format`. This is
an alias for `yarn prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,css,html,md}\"`.
